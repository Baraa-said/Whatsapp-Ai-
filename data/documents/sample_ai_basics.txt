# Sample Document: Artificial Intelligence Basics

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.

## Types of AI

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car). Most current AI applications fall into this category.

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)
General AI would have all the cognitive abilities of a human being, including the ability to understand any intellectual task that a human can.

### 3. Super AI
Superintelligent AI would surpass human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity, problem-solving, and social intelligence.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a field of AI that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. Applications include:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Translation services
- Sentiment analysis
- Text summarization

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It works by:
1. Retrieving relevant documents based on a query
2. Using the retrieved information as context
3. Generating responses that are grounded in the retrieved data

This approach helps reduce hallucinations and provides more accurate, contextual responses.

## Conclusion

AI continues to evolve rapidly, with new applications emerging across healthcare, finance, transportation, and many other sectors. Understanding the fundamentals helps in leveraging these technologies effectively.
